//7. At the top of the `liri.js` file, add code to read and set any environment variables with the dotenv package:

```js
require("dotenv").config();
```


// 8. Add the code required to import the `keys.js` file and store it in a variable.
  
// * You should then be able to access your keys information like so

//   ```js
//   var spotify = new Spotify(keys.spotify);
//   ```

// 9. Make it so liri.js can take in one of the following commands:

//    * `concert-this`

//    * `spotify-this-song`

//    * `movie-this`

//    * `do-what-it-says`

// ### What Each Command Should Do

// 1. `node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>`

//    * This will search the Bands in Town Artist Events API (`"https://rest.bandsintown.com/artists/" + artist + "/events?app_id=codingbootcamp"`) for an artist and render the following information about each event to the terminal:

//      * Name of the venue

//      * Venue location

//      * Date of the Event (use moment to format this as "MM/DD/YYYY")

// 2. `node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'`

//    * This will show the following information about the song in your terminal/bash window

//      * Artist(s)

//      * The song's name

//      * A preview link of the song from Spotify

//      * The album that the song is from

//    * If no song is provided then your program will default to "The Sign" by Ace of Base.





// * You will utilize the [node-spotify-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api) package in order to retrieve song information from the Spotify API.

// * The Spotify API requires you sign up as a developer to generate the necessary credentials. You can follow these steps in order to generate a **client id** and **client secret**:

// * Step One: Visit <https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/>

// * Step Two: Either login to your existing Spotify account or create a new one (a free account is fine) and log in.

// * Step Three: Once logged in, navigate to <https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications/create> to register a new application to be used with the Spotify API. You can fill in whatever you'd like for these fields. When finished, click the "complete" button.

// * Step Four: On the next screen, scroll down to where you see your client id and client secret. Copy these values down somewhere, you'll need them to use the Spotify API and the [node-spotify-api package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api).
